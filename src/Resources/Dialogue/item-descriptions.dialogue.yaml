    - Text: Chips are the ship board currency.  In the ancient times each new worker was implanted with one at the base of his skull, this would record his term of service and designation.  The lore of this proceedure has been lost over the centuries and now the chips serve a more mundane role as a token of commerce, each chip is worth a life (and lives are cheap).
