Wanderer is a game built upon the __most powerful graphics engine in the world: your imagination!__

Stalk the abandoned corridors and burned out machine rooms of a city sized starship.  Kill, sneak or talk your way through problems as you forge your own story.  Will you turn each room into a killing field; gather a loyal band of allies or unite a faction in rebellion against the status quo?
